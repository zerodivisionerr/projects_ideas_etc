Projects:
1. Flashcards Jupyter page or WebApp
2. Jupyter? my github to make it more prettier
3. Create Salt states that take stock machine (maybe baremetal or base OS, unsure if baremetal is reasonable) to fully
    configured and personalized (Arch primarily, but including Windows would be cool)

Flashcards App
- Can accepts definitions (key: value)
- Can offer randomly ordered keys/words and multiple choice, true/false answers  to choose from definitions
- Kepts track of session's correct:incorrect ratio and outputs percentage score at end
+ Utilize Jupyter or WebApp arch
+ DB required to store question/answer sets
+ Auth not necessary; KISS
